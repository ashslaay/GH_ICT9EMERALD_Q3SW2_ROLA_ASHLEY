            <td class="bg-danger">Alice in Borderland stars Kento Yamazaki as young unemployed gamer Ryohei Arisu, whose life changes drastically when he is mysteriously transported to a parallel universe in which he is forced to play a series of twisted games in order to remain alive. There's no telling who, exactly, is behind these games â€” Aliens?</td>
            <td class="bg-warning">Elena Houghlin is a scientist, engineer and inventor of Calisto -- a sustainable energy source that will revolutionize the way people use power. But when the cutting edge technology falls into the wrong hands, Elena turns to the Townsend Agency for help. Now, it's up to the Angels -- Jane, Sabina and the newly recruited Elena -- to retrieve Calisto before it can be transformed into a weapon of mass destruction.</td>
            <td class="bg-success">A virus outbreak occurs at Hyosan High School. The infected quickly turn into human eating zombies. Students at the high school must now fight for their lives, while they look for a way out. Nam On-Jo (Park Ji-Hu) & Lee Cheong-San (Yoon Chan-Young) have been friends since they were children. They are two of the students trapped in a classroom and surrounded by flesh eating zombies. Meanwhile, the Korean military work to isolate the outbreak and protect the country from an even larger outbreak.</td>
            <td class="bg-info"> After an unexpected family tragedy, Cha Hyun-soo leaves his home and moves into an apartment. Soon after, monsters begin appearing. People inside the apartment are trapped inside the building, realizing that monsters are lurking everywhere outside.</td>
            <td class="bg-primary">Evil wizard Gargamel (Hank Azaria) has plagued the happy, peaceful Smurfs for a very long time. Finally, he succeeds in chasing the little blue people from their village and through a magic portal -- which transports them to Manhattan and into the life of ad executive Patrick Winslow (Neil Patrick Harris). Only three apples high and lost in the Big Apple, the Smurfs (Jonathan Winters, Alan Cumming, Katy Perry) must find a way back to their world before Gargamel tracks them down.</td>
